This coalescing media is made of PP/HDPE/PVC. As the oil/water/solids mixture travels through the plates, oil rises to the top and solids drop to the bottom through dedicated surfaces and weep holes. Plate supports at the bottom allow for easy removal of the solids that collect beneath the plates. And, because of the steep angles and short travel distances, oils and solids are quickly released, making the media virtually self-cleaning</p>

There are three main factors affecting the rise rate; oil droplet size, oil specific gravity and temperature. Other factors include oil/dirt particles and flow rate or turbulence. According to Stoke's Law, a 100 micron size oil droplet will rise three inches in five minutes. When factoring in a flow rate, you can see how a simple oil/water separator will have to be quite large to give the oil enough time to rise to the surface. A 20 micron size oil droplet will rise three inches in 60 minutes. Large oil droplets are more buoyant and, therefore, rise faster.</p>

The concept of a coalescor is to use oleophillic (oil loving) media such as polypropylene or teflon. As oil and water flow through the media, oil droplets impinge on the media and coalesces on the surface. Coalescing, or binding together, makes them larger and more buoyant. As you can see from the above example, a 100 micron oil particle will rise three inches twelve times faster than a 20 micron particle.</p>

Also, solids or dirt will settle and glide downward on the plate surface. As it attaches to other dirt particles, the coalesced oil particles will gain buoyancy and rise rate, and the dirt particles will gain speed as they grow heavy and settle at a faster rate.</p>

The DAF removes the smaller particulate that pass through the screen. A DAF operates on the following principle of pressurizing the water with air to increase the air saturation into the water. The water then flows across a backpressure valve (the pressure is relieved), thereby allowing the air to come out of solution (effervesce) out of the water. This is the same reaction that happens  when you open a 7-up bottle and the bubbles come out of solution causing the bubbling. The micro bubbles produced in the DAF adhere to the small particulates in the wastewater. Once the bubble and particle adhere, they quickly float to the surface of the DAF where they are scraped off as a sludge.</p>

However, upflow velocities are much lower than utilized in the AFB process since no carrier material is provided. Instead the anaerobic active mass tends to form a granular type of sludge which assists with its retention in the anaerobic reactor. Various differences between UASB reactors were noted on visits to various European facilities. Some reactors are constructed of concrete; others of steel. Some reactors are rectangular; others are cylindrical. Some are moderate height (6 m); one extended 20 m high. The reactors generally had various proprietary designs for distributing influent and recirculated flows at the bottom as well as three-phase (effluent, solids, gas) separators at the top.</p>
